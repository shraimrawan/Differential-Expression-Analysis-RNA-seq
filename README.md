# Differential-Expression-Analysis-RNA-seq
Completing differential expression analysis using public RNA-seq data 
## Rna-seq
R markdown script requires a gene annotation table downloaded for gene ensembel 
The gene counts table fed into the script is generated from aligning rna-seq data of Pro-b cells to reference genome using STAR and extracting raw gene counts from STAR files
The script goes through normalizing the counts and graphing the data to check for certain gene markers in the data 

## Note
Still working on the script to include different groups and compare gene expression across groups of data
